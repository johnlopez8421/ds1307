# ds1307
DS1307 RTC library for for AVR 328P

This is a C library for the Dallas Semiconductor DS1307 RTC (real time clock). This was originally written for and tested on an Arduino clone with an Atmel 328P uC and an Adafruit DS1307 breakout board. This should expose all features of the 1307. This relies on my TWI/I2C library, but should be portable to other interfaces.
